# ⚠️ CRITICAL: USE OPENTOFU (tofu), NOT TERRAFORM

# This environment uses OpenTofu, not Terraform.
# NEVER run "terraform" commands in this directory!
#
# Mixing terraform and tofu will corrupt the state file and may destroy infrastructure.
#
# Use:
#   cd /path/to/pytorch-cloud
#   just tf-init production
#   just tf-plan production
#   just tf-apply production
#
# Or if you must run directly:
#   cd terraform/environments/production
#   tofu init
#   tofu plan
#   tofu apply
#
# See /CRITICAL-USE-TOFU.md for full details.
